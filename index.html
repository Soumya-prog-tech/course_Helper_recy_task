            <p class="new-year-message">I hope your year went well, filled with moments of growth,
                 joy, and valuable lessons. As we gracefully close this chapter, let us cherish the
                 memories we've created and the challenges we've overcome. The end of a year is not
                just a goodbye, but a chance to pause, reflect, and prepare ourselves for the endless 
                opportunities that lie ahead. With the new year approaching, let us welcome it with hope 
                in our hearts, resolutions to strive for, and gratitude for all that we have. May the 
                upcoming year bring happiness, success, and countless reasons to smile!</p>
